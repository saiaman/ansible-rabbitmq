RabbitMQ
=========

RabbitMQ playbook that enables you to spin up a simple server or cluster them together. If you are integrating this into another repo make sure that rabbitmq goes in the roles folder and that you have a top level folder called lookup_plugins with find_by_tag.py in it or this play will not be able to auto cluster. Currently only EC2 is supported but feel free to request support for other services you may want to use this with.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Example Playbook
----------------

Simple playbook that is enabled for use of clustering. If you are using rabbitmq_clustering you must gather facts. Never use the default key in production:

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      sudo: yes
      vars:
        rabbitmq_cluster: true
        rabbitmq_use_longname: "true"
      roles:
        - rabbitmq

Auto Clustering (EC2)
---------------------

This playbook has auto clustering support built in with the exception that you need to configure a few things.

You must first create a Launch Configuration (LC) that contains a user data file available via the advanced features dropdown on the Configure Details tab. An example file that you may want to place here would look like this.

    #!/bin/bash -ex
    exec > >(tee /var/log/user-data.log|logger -t user-data -s 2>/dev/console) 2>&1
    
    echo "BEGIN USER-DATA"
    

    #yum install -y -q python27-paramiko.noarch python27-PyYAML.x86_64 python27-jinja2 python27-simplejson python27-setuptools
    yum install -y -q git python27-pip.noarch
    
    pip install ansible
    
    # setup hosts
    echo "[rabbitmq]" > ~/ansible_hosts
    echo "localhost" >> ~/ansible_hosts
    export HOME=/root
    
    git clone git@github.com:your_playbook/ansible.git
    pushd ansible
    ansible-galaxy install --role-file=requirements.galaxy --force
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml  -t rabbitmq --connection=local
    popd
    rm -r ~/ansible ~/ansible_hosts
    
    echo "END USER-DATA"

You must also ensure that your servers are in the same security group and have the proper ports open to each other as well as being in the same VPC. The ports that need to be open can be found in the rabbitmq documentation. You will likely only need 4369, 25672, 15672, and 5672. If you are having issues open up all ports to everything for testing to ensure the security group is not the issue.

Add the LC you have made to an Auto Scale Group (ASG) and set the number of servers to spin up.
